How to use Gorilla Tag cosmetics because ALOT of people dont know how to and i want to help the @Helpers a bit 



The first thing you want to do is join the Gorilla Tag Modding discord --> https://discord.gg/monkemod

Next you want to install the most resent version of QuestPatcher or QP for short https://github.com/Lauriethefish/QuestPatcher/releases/

After that you will open QP after you open QP you will get a windows prompt just click More Info and Run anyway you will also get another prompt just click yes

Now open QP and plugin your headset!(quest 1 or 2)

Once you are in QP click the Patch My App! button and wait for a bit

In the VR dont click restore app or you have to do the last step again

After you do that you need to install gorilla cosmetics! --> https://github.com/RedBrumbler/GorillaCosmetics/releases/download/v1.2.9/GorillaCosmetics.qmod

After you intall the .QMOD you drag and drop it into QP and it dose the rest for you!

Now you want custom hats or mats? Ok! Go to the #Hats Or #mats channel in the discord download the file then open QP and drag the .GMAT or .HAT file into QP!
